# 10 Essential Resume Keywords That Get You Noticed by ATS Systems  

If you’ve ever applied for a job online, chances are your resume was first read by an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** before it ever reached a recruiter’s eyes. These systems scan resumes for specific keywords to determine whether you’re a strong match for the role. If your resume doesn’t include the right terms, it could get filtered out—even if you’re highly qualified.  

The good news? You can beat the ATS by tailoring your resume with smart keyword usage. Below, we’ll explore **10 essential resume keywords** that not only help you pass ATS filters but also make you stand out to hiring managers.
